## Project Task Overview

**Task**: Create an application that tracks banner views while displaying pages with a banner. The application should record user data and viewing time without using any frameworks.

The project should contain a minimum of 4 files:
- index1.html
- index2.html
- banner.php
- scheme.sql

The MySQL table structure should have the following mandatory columns:
- _ip_address_
- _user_agent_
- _view_date_
- _page_url_
- _views_count_


The **index1.html** and **index2.html** pages should have an image tag that inserts some image into the page using **banner.php** file: _< img src="banner.php" >_

Every time the image is loaded, the page visitor's info should be recorded in the MySQL table:
- IP address of the visitor (_ip_address_ column);
- Their user-agent (_user_agent_ column);
- The date and time the image was shown for this visitor (_view_date_ column);
- URL of the page where the image was loaded (_page_url_ column);
- Number of image loads for the same visitor (_views_count_ column).

If a user with the same IP address, user-agent, and page URL hits the page again, the _view_date_ column has to be updated with the current date and time, as well as views_count column has to be increased by 1.
